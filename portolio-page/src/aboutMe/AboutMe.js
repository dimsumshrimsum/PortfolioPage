          <p>
            Im Zachary, but please feel free to call me Zach. I'm inspired by
            learning new things and coding provides a limitless spring of new
            things to learn. Solving problems has always provided a unique
            degree of satisfaction, and the world of software development has
            given a level of tangibility to complex problems that has incited in
            me, a passion for coding. Ive worked in customer service, ive worked
            in sales, Ive driven forklifts and box trucks, Ive built patios and
            delivered Appliances, all the while, one thing has been the same,
            Ive loved being part of a team, Ive loved reaching towards a common
            goal, and I've loved pushing myself. I may be new to the world of
            sofware development, but I am eager and excited to learn and grow as
            a developer. When Im not coding I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Rock
            Climb. I play a number of musical instruments, am an avid painter,
            and I also enjoy table top games. I try to serve my community and
            currently tutor local underserved spanish speaking 3rd-6th graders.
            I strive for a greater good in all that I do and I hope to bring
            that to the table as a developer.
